# 📘 Python to Production — Core Python Fundamentals  
### *Everything you actually need for Data Science, Analytics, ML, and Production Systems*  
By **Prerna Joshi** | #25DaysOfDataTech | #PythonToProduction  

---

## 🌟 Why This Repository?

Most beginners learn Python in a scattered way — random tutorials, disconnected examples, too many topics at once.

This repository fixes that.

Here, you’ll find a clear, structured set of Jupyter notebooks that build the **strong Python foundation** you need before jumping into Pandas, SQL, ML models, RAG systems, APIs, or cloud engineering.

If you skip fundamentals today, you *will* regret it later.  
So go slow. Learn at your own pace. Build it right.

## 📂 Repository Overview

This repo contains **9 fully explained notebooks**, covering the Python concepts that matter the most in real-world analytics and ML workflows.

Each notebook is practical, example-rich, and beginner-friendly.

| Notebook | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **01_python_basics_variables_datatypes.ipynb** | Introduction to Python, variables, data types, numbers, expressions — your essential building blocks. |
| **02_python_operators_controlflow.ipynb** | Conditionals (`if/elif/else`), boolean logic, comparison operators — the logic behind every program. |
| **03_python_loops_in_depth.ipynb** | For loops, while loops, break/continue, nested loops, clean looping patterns. |
| **04_functions_and_scope_LEGB.ipynb** | Functions, parameters, return values, scope resolution (LEGB), modular code design. |
| **05_core_data_structures.ipynb** | Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries — your everyday data containers in analytics and ML. |
| **05.1_collections.ipynb** | `Counter`, `defaultdict`, `deque`, `namedtuple`, `OrderedDict` — when you need more power than built-ins. |
| **06_strings_text_processing.ipynb** | Text cleaning, string methods, slicing, formatting — extremely useful for data cleaning. |
| **07_functional_programming.ipynb** | Lambdas, map/filter/reduce, immutability, list/dict comprehensions — the Pythonic way to transform data. |
| **08_object_oriented_programming.ipynb** | Classes, objects, methods, attributes — the useful OOP you’ll actually use in ML workflows. |
| **09_idioms_and_best_practices.ipynb** | Pythonic writing, readability, performance patterns, clean code principles. |

## 🚀 What You Will Learn (Real-World Skills)

### ✔ Data Types & Variables  
Understand Python’s core building blocks to avoid hidden bugs later.

### ✔ Loops & Control Flow  
Write clean, efficient logic — essential for all automation and data manipulation.

### ✔ Comprehensions  
A Python superpower: shorter, faster, cleaner transformations.

### ✔ Functions  
Build reusable components, modular pipelines, and cleaner notebooks.

### ✔ File Handling  
Read/write files, process logs, parse text — real tasks in data engineering.

### ✔ OOP (Beginner-Friendly)  
Learn the *practical* parts: classes, objects, `__init__`, methods.  
Useful for:
- ML model wrappers  
- Config loaders  
- Data pipelines  
- API structures  

### ✔ Best Practices  
Write code that looks like a professional wrote it.
